# MythOS

An operating system for the Grove

## Development (on Mac OS)

First, be sure you have Node and NPM installed.

To run the tests and build the OS, run `./build.sh` from
the repo root directory. This copies the built code to
the clipboard, whence you can paste it into a Grove's
`startup` record.
